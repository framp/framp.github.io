I learned C++ and AutoIt to write desktop applications; I then moved to the web with PHP and JS. I started a few communities around security and programming and started experimenting with advertising revenue and selling software.</p><p>In 2007 I decided to leave hacking behind and focus entirely on   <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/u/framp" target="_blank">freelancing</a>. Eventually I was able to grow a pool of repeated customers and stop competing with developers from LCOL countries. Through countless iterations, the prototype of an API creation framework was born - which would then turn into   <a href="https://apiplant.com" target="_blank">APIPlant</a>.</p><p>While freelancing, I jumped on the node.js bandwagon and I started building products, until   <a href="https://freedsound.com/" target="_blank">one</a> became successful enough to pay all my expenses. In 2013, I decided to pursue bigger goals: I co-founded   <a href="https://zensuite.framp.me/" target="_blank">a startup</a> and moved to London to recruit a team.</p><p>In 2015, many lessons later, we ran out of money. I got disillusioned with the startup world and started offering my services to the world once more. I then ventured in the corporate and startup world, putting some notches on my career. I started playing around with Machine Learning and exploring a new promising language, Rust.</p><p>After adding a few more products under the   <a href="https://apiplant.com" target="_blank">APIPlant</a> umbrella, in 2021 I decided I had enough of the rainy weather and high taxes - and moved to Paphos, Cyprus.</p><p>I didn't spend all my time at beach: I helped organize the   <a href="https://cdc.cy/" target="_blank">Cyprus Developers Community</a> and started a   <a href="https://cyprusrust.org" target="_blank">Rust User Group</a>. With the boom of AI, I started working entirely on Generative AI projects, splitting my time between building chat assistants with RAG and generating video and audio.</p><p>Will this newfound experience turn into a new product?
