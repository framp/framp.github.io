I learned C++ and AutoIt to write desktop applications; I then moved to the web with PHP and JS. I started a few communities around security and programming and started experimenting with advertising revenue and selling software.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>In 2007 I decided to leave hacking behind and focus entirely on &nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.freelancer.com/u/framp\" target=\"_blank\">freelancing</a>. Eventually I was able to grow a pool of repeated customers and stop competing with developers from LCOL countries. Through countless iterations, the prototype of an API creation framework was born - which would then turn into &nbsp; <a href=\"https://apiplant.com\" target=\"_blank\">APIPlant</a>.</p>\n\n      <p>\n        While freelancing, I jumped on the node.js bandwagon and I started building products, until &nbsp; <a href=\"https://freedsound.com/\" target=\"_blank\">one</a> became successful enough to pay all my expenses. In 2013, I decided to pursue bigger goals: I co-founded &nbsp; <a href=\"http://zensuite.framp.me/\" target=\"_blank\">a startup</a> and moved to London to recruit a team.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        In 2015, many lessons later, we ran out of money. I got disillusioned with the startup world and started offering my services to the world once more. I then ventured in the corporate and startup world, putting some notches on my career.\n        I started playing around with Machine Learning and exploring a new promising language, Rust.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        After adding a few more products under the &nbsp; <a href=\"https://apiplant.com\" target=\"_blank\">APIPlant</a> umbrella, in 2021 I decided I had enough of the rainy weather and high taxes - and moved to Paphos, Cyprus.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        I didn't spend all my time at beach: I helped organize the &nbsp; <a href=\"https://cdc.cy/\" target=\"_blank\">Cyprus Developers Community</a> and started a &nbsp; <a href=\"https://cyprusrust.org\" target=\"_blank\">Rust User Group</a>.\n        With the boom of AI, I started working entirely on Generative AI projects, splitting my time between building chat assistants with RAG and generating video and audio.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Will this newfound experience turn into a new product?
